        <dt><big>HISTORY :</big></dt>
        <DD><P align="justify">The temple is believed to be built in 625 A.D by the King Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty to commemorate his victory over Vengi region of Andhra Desham, as per the writings on the temple wall.Kakatiya kings later have adopted the temple and considered Goddess Bhadrakali as their kuladevata. A lake was also built by Ganapati-deva adjacent to the temple. Due to the fall of Kakatiya dynasty to the Muslim rulers of Delhi, the temple lost its prominence. The Kakatiyas negotiated a truce with Allauddin Khilji by offering the diamond in exchange not to be invaded. He sent his slave and personal confidant Malik Kufur to personally transport the diamond. In 1950, the temple was renovated by Sri Ganesh Rao Sastri a devi upasaka along with Gujrati businessman Shri Maganlal Sameja.</P></DD>
