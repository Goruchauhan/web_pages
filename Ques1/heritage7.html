        <DD><P align="justify">During our quest to find places to visit near Hyderabad, we found the Ghanpur Group of Temples. This was another bike trip, we stumbled upon this lesser-known Ghanpur Group of Temples.  Honestly, despite planning the trip, we had absolutely no idea about these temples. Thanks to the board by Telangana Tourism, we thought of driving an extra 11 kms for a detour to the temple. Of course, we didn't regret it..</P></DD>

        <dt><big>HISTORY :</big></dt>
        <DD><P align="justify">Many Hindu temples were developed under the patronage of Ganapati Deva, Rudrama Devi and Prataparudra who were of Kakatiya dynasty. The Thousand Pillar Temple was believed to be constructed during the period between 1175â€“1324 CE by order of the king, Rudra Deva. It stands out to be a masterpiece and achieved major heights in terms of architectural skills by the ancient Kakatiya Vishwakarma Sthapathis (Architect). The Executive officer of the subject temple is P.Venugopal.It was desecrated by the Tughlaq dynasty during their invasion of the Deccan. However, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad,(Mir Osman Ali Khan) donated a grant of 1 Lakh INR towards the reconstruction of this temple.</P></DD>
