        <DD><P align="justify">Ramappa Temple, also known as the Rudreswara temple, is a Kakatiya style Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, located in Telangana, India. It is 15 km (9.3 mi) from Mulugu, 66 km (41 mi) from Warangal, 209 km (130 mi) from Hyderabad. An inscription in the temple says it was constructed in the year 1213 CE by Recherla Rudraâ€”a general of Kakatiya ruler Ganapati Deva.</P></DD>

        <DD><P align="justify">Some bricks of the Ramappa temple and Humayun's tomb were sent for examination to Dr. Habib Haman, Chief Chemist of Government Industrial Laboratory, Hyderabad, Dn. He has kindly reported as follows: 'The samples of floating bricks from Bidar are similar to those from Warangal as far as the method of manufacture is concerned. The material used to make the brick spongy was apparently saw-dust.  The Bidar specimens show better quality as regards homogeneous mixing and uniform burning than their proto-types from Ramappa, as a result of which the porosity is well-maintained in the body of bricks from Bidar and they float well in water.</P></DD>
